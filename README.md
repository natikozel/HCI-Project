## Overview

This is a final project for the Human-Computer Integrations college course, showcasing an application designed to simplify the process of paying apartment taxes. The app is built using React, with Figma for design prototyping, and incorporates an AI-based Figma generator.


## Key Features

- **React**: The frontend of the application is built using React, written in TypeScript.

- **Figma**: Figma was used for design prototyping.

- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: The application is implemented as a single-page application (SPA), where the entire application runs within a single web page. This approach provides a seamless user experience by avoiding page reloads during navigation.

- **SPA Page Navigations**: React's SPA page navigation capabilities were leveraged to provide smooth transitions between different sections of the application. This ensures a seamless user experience and faster page loading times.
